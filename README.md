### Usage

For an easy copy of the cookies, you can install an Add-On like `cookies.txt` [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) or [for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-clean/ahmnmhfbokciafffnknlekllgcnafnie). Export the cookies of your login page (e.g. of `ukzn.idm.oclc.org` or `gobi3.com`) to a `cookies.txt` file. 

Alternatively, you can create the `cookies.txt` file yourself, keep in mind it needs to be in Netscape format like this (`a3azaHajajaLada` is the cookie):

```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
# http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html
# This is a generated file!  Do not edit.

.idm.oclc.org	TRUE	/	FALSE	2147483647	ezproxy	a3azaHajajaLada
#HttpOnly_.idm.oclc.org	TRUE	/	FALSE	2147483647	ezproxyl	a3azaHajajaLada
#HttpOnly_.idm.oclc.org	TRUE	/	TRUE	2147483647	ezproxyn	a3azaHajajaLada
```

Copy the `cookies.txt` file to the directory where you want to download the books. Open a terminal inside of that directory.

Open an ebook on your library in your browser, so you get a link that looks like this: `https://web-p-ebscohost-com.ukzn.idm.oclc.org/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/somebookidentifier?sid=yoursessionid@redis&vid=0&format=EK&rid=1`

or like this: `https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=yoursessionid%40redis&vid=0&format=EB`

or like this: `https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/somebookidentifier?sid=yoursessionid@redis&vid=3&lpid=lp_5&format=EB`

or like this: `https://research.ebsco.com/c/user_id/ebook-viewer/pdf/book_id` In this case also export the ebsco cookies.


You can download this book now using this command: `ebsco-dl https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=yoursessionid%40redis&vid=0&format=EB`. The book will be downloaded in the current working directory, you can change this behavior by using the `--path` option.

If you run into certificate problems you can add `-scv` to the command, so that the certificate is not validated.
